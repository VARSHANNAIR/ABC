Overview:

This project involves analyzing a dataset from ABC Company, which contains information about 458 employees across various teams. The primary objectives are to preprocess the dataset, perform detailed analysis, visualize the findings, and summarize the insights gained.
he analysis reveals a diverse workforce distribution across NBA teams, with varying employee counts and percentage splits. Some teams, like the New Orleans Pelicans and the Memphis Grizzlies, have larger staff sizes, possibly indicating more extensive support structures or broader operational scopes. Conversely, teams with smaller staff sizes may have leaner organizational structures or focus on specific areas of operation.
This distribution underscores the importance of effective resource allocation and team management within each franchise. It enables teams to optimize their workforce, align resources with strategic goals, and ensure operational efficiency across different departments and functions.
Understanding the distribution of employees across NBA teams is essential for each franchise's management to make informed decisions regarding staffing, team composition, and resource allocation, ultimately contributing to overall organizational success and performance.
 The analysis reveals a moderate positive correlation (correlation coefficient approximately 0.382) between age and salary within the organization. This suggests that, on average, as employees' age increases, their salaries tend to increase as well.
